        "text": "Mogu li zaista povjerovati svojim srcem da si uskrsnuo i da si zaista u svakom trenutku prisutan u svakome dijelu svijeta. Mogu li povjerovati da si i sada ovdje prisutan, da \u017eeli\u0161 biti u mome dru\u0161tvu. Unato\u010d tome \u0161to mi moje misli govore da je to nemogu\u0107e, unato\u010d tome \u0161to mi moje rane govore kako Te ja ne zanimam, mogu li se ipak odva\u017eiti i re\u0107i Ti da Ti vjerujem. \nToliko je toga \u010demu robujem, odnosno smatram kako bez toga ne mogu. Toliko je toga u \u0161to ula\u017eem \u010ditavo svoje srce, a opet to isto srce ne osje\u0107a ispunjenost. Mno\u0161tvo je mojih la\u017enih bogova koji mi kradu radost u \u017eivotu i svaki puta kada odlu\u010dim da \u0107u prestati ne uspijevam dugo izdr\u017eati. Mo\u017eda je moja vjera u neuspjeh puno ja\u010da, nego vjera u Tvoju svemogu\u0107nost. \nZanimljivo je kako se olako prepustim nevjeri i kako me tada ne napada osje\u0107aj vjere. No kada odlu\u010dim vjerovati \u010ditavo se moje bi\u0107e buni i sumnja. Ti zna\u0161 Isuse da moje srce samo ne mo\u017ee i da mu treba Tvoja pomo\u0107. Ja \u017eelim vjerovati, \u017eelim sada na glas ponavljati kako Ti vjerujem i kako vjerujem da si Tu pored mene. \nJa vjerujem da me Ti \u017eeli\u0161 \u010duti, ja vjerujem da Ti je stalo, ja vjerujem da me Ti vi\u0161e od i\u010dega \u017eeli\u0161 ozdraviti i osloboditi od moga ropstva. Ja vjerujem da me Ti \u017eeli\u0161 dotaknuti, ja vjerujem da me \u017eeli\u0161 u\u010diniti posve novim, ja vjerujem da je Tvoja Ljubav sna\u017enija od moga srama i grijeha, ja vjerujem da si Ti jedini koji mo\u017ee moje rane razumjeti i iscijeliti, ja vjerujem da si Ti zaista svemogu\u0107, ja vjerujem da je Tvoja volja za moj \u017eivot bolja od moje volje. Ja Ti vjerujem, ja Ti vjerujem.",

        "text": "\u201cTeacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you are not concerned with anyone\u2019s opinion. You do not regard a person\u2019s status but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.\u201d  Mark 12:14a\n\nThis statement was made by some of the Pharisees and Herodians who were sent to \u201censnare\u201d Jesus in His speech.  They act in a sneaky and cunning way to draw Jesus in.  They are trying to get Him to speak in opposition to Caesar so that they can get Him in trouble with the Roman authorities.  But interestingly, what they say of Jesus is quite true and is a great virtue.  \n\nThey say two things that highlight Jesus\u2019 virtues of humility and sincerity: 1) \u201cYou are not concerned with anyone\u2019s opinion;\u201d 2) \u201cYou do not regard a person\u2019s status.\u201d  Of course they went on to then try to trick Him into breaking Roman law.  Jesus does not fall for their trick and does outsmart them in the end.\n\nHowever, these virtues are good for us to reflect upon because we should strive to have them alive in our own lives.  First, we should not be concerned with others\u2019 opinions.  But this must be properly understood.  Sure, it\u2019s important to listen to others and to consult them and to be open minded.  Other people\u2019s insights can be crucial to making good decisions in life.  But what we should avoid is the danger of allowing others to dictate our actions out of fear.  Sometimes the \u201copinions\u201d of others are negative and wrong.  We can all experience peer pressure in various ways.  Jesus never gave in to the false opinions of others nor did He allow the pressure of those opinions to change how He acted.\n\nSecondly, they point out that Jesus does not allow the \u201cstatus\u201d of another to influence Him.  Again, this is a virtue.  What we have to know is that all people are equal in the mind of God.  A position of power or influence does not necessarily make one person more correct than another.  What\u2019s important is the sincerity, integrity and truthfulness of each person.  Jesus exercised this virtue perfectly.\n\nReflect, today, upon whether these words could also be said about you.  Strive to learn from the statement of these Pharisees and Herodians; strive to live a life of integrity and humility.  If you do so, you will also be given a share in the wisdom of Jesus so as to navigate the most difficult snares of life.\n\nLord, I do want to be a person of honesty and integrity.  I want to listen to the good advice of others but not be influenced by the errors or pressures that may also come my way.  Help me to always seek You and Your truth in all things.  Jesus, I trust in You.",
